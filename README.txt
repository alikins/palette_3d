This is a tool to visualize RGB color palettes in 3D. 

It is built in Processing (http://processing.org). 


Useage:

Left/Right scrolls through the lists of available palettes.
Hitting the space bar switches between showing the colors in RGB vs HSB space.
Up/Down controls the size of the points used to show the color points. 
'b' turns the outline of the rgb space box on and off.
